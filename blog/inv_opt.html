        <h2 class="section-header">What is Inventory Optimization?</h2>
        <p>Inventory optimization is the process of ensuring that the right amount of stock is available at the right time to meet customer demand without overstocking or understocking. 
            The goal is to minimize costs related to inventory while maximizing service levels.</p>
        <p>Efficient inventory optimization helps businesses reduce storage costs, avoid stockouts, and improve cash flow.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">What is Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)?</h2>
        <p>The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is a fundamental concept in inventory management that helps businesses determine the optimal order size that minimizes total inventory costs. The EOQ formula balances ordering costs and holding costs to find the most cost-effective order quantity.</p>
        <p>The EOQ formula is:</p>
        <!-- <code>EOQ = √((2 * D * S) / H)</code> -->
        <p>\[
            EOQ = \sqrt{\frac{2 * D * S}{H}}
            \]</p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>D</strong> = Demand rate (units per period)</li>
            <li><strong>S</strong> = Ordering cost per order</li>
            <li><strong>H</strong> = Holding cost per unit per period</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This formula is obtained by minimizing total cost which includes ordering cost \(\frac{D}{Q}*O\) and inventory holding cost \(\frac{Q}{2}*H\). 
            When we add them and take derivative w.r.t. \(Q\) and equates to zero we will get the value of \(Q\) which is basically \(EOQ\) </p>

        <p>The assumption in deriving the above formuala is as follows: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The demand for the product is constant and known.</li>
            <li>Constant lead time</li>
            <li>Constant Ordering Cost (S)</li>
            <li>Constant Holding Cost (H)</li>
            <li>No Stockouts</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-header">Inventory Curve</h2>
        <p>The inventory curve represents the levels of stock over time, showing how inventory decreases 
            as sales occur and is replenished as orders are placed. It typically has a sawtooth pattern, 
            with the inventory level dropping during sales and rising after each replenishment order.</p>
        <p>At the point where inventory is lowest, businesses face the risk of stockouts, while higher 
            levels represent overstocking and unnecessary holding costs.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-header">Cost Factors in Inventory Optimization</h2>
        <p>Inventory optimization involves managing several key costs that affect inventory levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ordering Costs:</strong> Costs incurred each time an order is placed, such as shipping, handling, and administrative costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Holding Costs:</strong> Costs associated with storing inventory, including storage fees, insurance, and opportunity costs of tying up capital.</li>
            <li><strong>Stockout Costs:</strong> Costs incurred when inventory runs out, leading to lost sales, customer dissatisfaction, or expedited shipping to replenish stock.</li>
            <li><strong>Shortage Costs:</strong> Costs related to the inability to meet customer demand due to insufficient inventory.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-header">Reorder Point and Safety Stock Calculation</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Reorder Point (ROP)</strong> is the inventory level at which a new order should be placed to avoid stockouts. It depends on the demand rate and lead time.</p>
        <p>The formula for ROP is:</p>
        <!-- <code>ROP = Demand rate × Lead time</code> -->
         <p>
            \[
                ROP = \mu_d*L
            \]
         </p>
         <p>Where:</p>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>\(\mu_d\): </strong>daily avearage demand</li>
            <li><strong>\(L\): </strong>Lead time in days</li>
         </ul>
        <p>Since in practical scenarios, we don't have linear demand curve, we need to add a buffer amount to redorder point 
            so that an uncertainty in demand is catered and stockout is minimized. This buffer quantity is called <strong> Safety Stock</strong>
        </p>
        <!-- <p>Additionally, safety stock is used to buffer against uncertainty in demand and lead time. 
            The safety stock calculation typically considers 
            the standard deviation of demand and lead time, as well as desired service levels.</p> -->
        <p>A common safety stock formula is:</p>
        <p>
            \[
                SS = Z*\sigma_{d}*\sqrt{L}
            \]
        </p>
        <!-- <code>Safety Stock = Z × σ(Demand) × √Lead time</code> -->
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>\(Z\): </strong> Z-score corresponding to the desired service level; 1.62 for 95%</li>
            <li><strong>\(\sigma_{d}\): </strong>Standard deviation of daily demand</li>
            <li><strong>\(L\): </strong>Lead time in days</li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h2 class="section-header">Newsvendor Model</h2>
        <p>The Newsvendor Model is used to optimize inventory in environments with uncertain demand, typically 
            for <strong>perishable goods</strong>  or <strong>seasonal products</strong> which includes 
            <strong>airline ticket</strong>, <strong>concert ticket</strong> and <strong>hotels</strong>.
            The model helps determine the optimal order quantity by balancing the costs of overstocking and understocking.</p>
        <p>The key is to minimize the total cost of inventory by considering both:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Overstocking cost / Overage cost (\(C_o\)):</strong> The cost incurred when you order more than necessary.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Salvage Value </li>
                    <li>Inventory Holding Cost</li>
                    <li>Opportunity Cost</li>
                </ul>
            <li><strong>Understocking cost / Underage cost (\(C_u\)):</strong> The cost incurred when you order too little 
                and miss sales opportunities. This Cost is difficult to calculate.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Goodwill cost</li>
                    <li>Expedite Cost (fee paid to get product sooner)</li>
                    <li>Increased Supplier Cost (Cost difference between primary and secondary suppliers) </li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>The Newsvendor model can be solved using the following formula as <strong>Critical Ratio (CR)</strong>:</p>
        <!-- <code>Critical ratio (CR) = Cu / (Cu + Co)</code> -->
         <p>
            \[
                CR = \frac{C_u}{C_u + C_o} 
            \]
         </p>
        <p>By determining the critical ratio, we can calculate the optimal order quantity as follows.</p>
        <p>
            \[
                Q = \mu + Z_{CR}*\sigma
            \]
        </p>
        <p>Where:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>\(Q\): </strong>Optimal order quantity</li>
            <li><strong>\(\mu\): </strong>Average daily demand</li>
            <li><strong>\(Z_{CR}\): </strong>Z-score corresponding to the critical ratio (desired service level); 1.62 for CR=0.95</li>
            <li><strong>\(\sigma\): </strong>Standard deviation of daily demand</li>
            
        </ul>
